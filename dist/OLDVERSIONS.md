# Suffusion Archive

## Latest Version

The [`dist` folder](https://github.com/sayontan/suffusion/tree/master/dist) contains the latest version and the previous version of the theme. 

## Old Versions

Note that the last version officially released through WordPress was 4.4.9. The ZIP file corresponding to it has been made available in the `dist` folder (see below). 

In addition, there have been two minor modifications to the code (made available as Version 4.5.0):

* A correction to the code for Audio Post Formats to prevent a fatal error. Note that the error wouldn't occur if you have the Suffusion Shortcodes plugin

* A small change to allow jQuery Cycle to be used if [Photonic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/photonic) is active. Photonic switched to using a different slideshow script in version 1.62

Old versions from 4.4.9 to the latest are available in this folder.

## Changelog

The complete changelog as of 3.7.4 is available [here](https://github.com/sayontan/suffusion/blob/master/code/ChangeLog.txt).
